# PCF8574 STM32 HAL
### A simple HAL I2C library for the GPIO expansor PCF8574
This library was made for the GPIO expansor shown in the image in this repo, there are just two functions, both read/write the whole 8 bits in one instruction.

I have test this code with the STM32F411 with the STM32CubeIDE.
